# Filters
Filtering is a technique for modifying or enhancing an image. For example, you can filter an image to emphasize certain features or remove other features. Image processing operations implemented with filtering include smoothing, sharpening, and edge enhancement.

This project allows one to apply Brightness, Contrast, Saturation and Vignette filters to an image selected from the device gallery.
